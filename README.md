# Taskmaster-Pro-Edition

Impressed by your previous work, which you've showcased on your portfolio website, a company called Taskmaster has recruited you to expand their task-management application.

The Taskmaster website includes an Add Task button, a Delete Tasks button, and a list of tasks in a To Do column

The app comes with these nifty features:

Users can create tasks with descriptions and due dates.

Task data is persistent, thanks to localStorage.

The Delete All button can delete tasks.

The functionality behind these features should sound familiar, because you've accomplished similar DOM manipulation and data persistence previouslyâ€”but Taskmaster was built using different tools. You wrote your earlier projects in plain JavaScript, using methods that the browser understood right out of the box. The Taskmaster app, however, incorporates third-party libraries like jQuery and Bootstrap. These libraries don't replace regular JavaScript and CSS; instead, they add new methods and classes that expedite development.

This project also comes with the added weight of legacy code, or an adopted codebase you didn't write. Not only is it old, but it might use obsolete tools. Developers often face legacy code on the job, so Taskmaster is a great opportunity to practice reading unfamiliar code!

As you work to level-up Taskmaster, you'll learn these new skills along the way:

Learn to consult documentation when faced with new libraries.

Traverse and manipulate the DOM using jQuery methods.

Attach delegated browser events to elements with jQuery methods.

Implement a better user experience with focus and blur events.

Practice other applications of this to distinguish between clicked elements.
